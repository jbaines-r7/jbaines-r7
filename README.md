Vulnerability researcher that sometimes gets lucky. Two-time DEFCON speaker. Occasional blogger. Currently using this account for:

* PoC & Exploit development
* Metasploit contributions

You can find some of my other work:

* https://attackerkb.com/contributors/jbaines-r7
* https://github.com/jacob-baines (mostly in hibernation, because managing two accounts is too hard)

I tweet somewhat regularly as [@Junior_Baines](https://twitter.com/Junior_Baines).
